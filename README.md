# firstnodeapp

Basically its a basic nodejs application with crud operations. There is a json file consisting of information regarding each student i.e. his rollno,name and marks.
The operations we can perform are as follows:-
1) View all the students : localhost:5500/getall
2) View a particular student with x roll no : localhost:5500/get/x where x is the roll no
3) To add a new student : localhost:5500/add
4) To update a student info : localhost:5500/update
5) To delete a student with particular roll no : localhost:5500/delete/x where x is the roll no 

Thanks for reading.
